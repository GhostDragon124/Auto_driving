Autonomous Driving System Development Using YOLO and CARLA Simulator

Objective: Developed a comprehensive autonomous driving system capable of real-time traffic analysis and decision-making based on traffic rules.

Technologies Used:

YOLO Object Detection Models: Implemented YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5 algorithms for accurate detection of traffic signals, vehicles, pedestrians, and other road entities.
CARLA Simulator: Utilized CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulator, to create realistic driving environments for testing and validation.
Deep Learning Frameworks: Employed PyTorch for model development and training.
Dataset Handling: Worked with the Udacity Self-Driving Car Dataset, performing data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
Key Contributions:

Real-Time Object Detection: Achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying road elements, enabling the vehicle to respond appropriately to various traffic scenarios such as stopping at red lights, yielding to pedestrians, and avoiding obstacles.
Algorithm Optimization: Compared and analyzed different YOLO versions to identify the most efficient model in terms of speed and accuracy for autonomous driving applications.
System Integration: Successfully integrated the YOLO models with the CARLA simulator to test driving strategies like stopping, evasion, traffic light adherence, and emergency braking under diverse conditions, including dynamic weather adaptations.
Performance Evaluation: Conducted extensive experiments and evaluations using confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and other metrics to assess model performance and improve detection robustness.
Teamwork and Collaboration:

Worked collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team to manage project timelines, divide tasks efficiently, and integrate individual components into a cohesive system.
Contributed to team discussions on overcoming challenges such as processing bottlenecks, data handling complexities, and ensuring system compatibility across different hardware and software configurations.
Outcomes:

Enhanced the autonomous driving system's ability to interpret and react to complex road conditions with improved safety and efficiency.
Provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of various YOLO models in real-world simulation environments.
Laid the groundwork for future improvements in autonomous vehicle perception systems, focusing on accuracy, real-time processing, and adaptability to dynamic driving scenarios.
